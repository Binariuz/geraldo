CHARTS
======

Test to implement charts generation on Geraldo, with no dependency to MatPlotLib,
Cairoplot or any other reports generator.

Even if being the most powerful charting library, MatPlotLib is very hard to
implement on a report, and since Geraldo already depends on ReportLab and it
has already a good charting generation kit, the best choice is use it.

    >>> from reportlab.graphics import charts

There are 2D and 3D charts, and there are many types of them. Besides that, there
are some different ways to get data to draw them.
